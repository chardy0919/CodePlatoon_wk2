# Five Pillars of OOP:

# Encapsulation = Data access can be restricted based on needs
# Abstraction = Logic/Complexity is hidden, for simplicity
# Inheritance = Sharing of similar features and attributes (Is-a)
# Composition = Including other Objects as attributes (Has-a)
# Polymorphism = Objects can take different forms depending on needs/situation

class Dog:
    pass

fido = Dog()
